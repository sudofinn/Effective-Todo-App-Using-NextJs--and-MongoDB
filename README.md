# Todo App with NextJS and MongoDB

## Description

This is a minimal Todo App made with NextJS, MongoDB, Chakra UI and Framer Motion.
The primary goal was to keep this as simple as possible so that it is easy to replicate.

## Install, run
git clone "url of the repo" cd my-cloned-app

npm install npm start

//localhost:3000

## Technologies
NextJs ( w. create-next-app) , MongoDB (backend) , Chakra ui ( ui library) Framer Motion ( animation library) ❤️
Note that the backend has lots of keys so you have to make your own account at MongoDB or whatever database you want to use. In these files, only the rough layout is depicted ( it will only work if you add you code to it). There are some
dummy texts for the todos, replace these w. the ones you get from MongoDB.

## Usage
Use the code whenever , wherever you want. No credits needed ! ✌️
